    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am an IT studying at ADA University.
        My main interests are data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
        I also enjoy learning how websites work and how code turns into real products.
        In my free times, I like to play chess and watch football.
        I strongly believe that right balance between studies and hobbies is the key to success.

        This portfolio website was created as a part of my university project.
        Through this project, I have learned the basics of Html and Css.
        I hope that I will expand my knowledge in web development in the future.
